This my personal vim home, my own cozy place for my vim settings.

Cloning this repository into ```~/.vim``` will set vim up the way I like it.

For example:

```
$ git clone https://www.github.com/Sheco/vim-settings ~/.vim
```

Let it download some plugins, it might take a minute, after that, it's completely ready.
